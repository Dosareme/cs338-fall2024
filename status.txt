I will be using VMware on my Windows laptop to run a virtualized Kali installation. I have everything set up and successfully visited the "dangerous website" from the instructions.
This laptop only has 8GB of memory which makes me a bit anxious with the VM wanted 2GB to itself and Windows already naturally eating up about 4GB, but I think I should still be in the clear.
