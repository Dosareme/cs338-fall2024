3) 	The client port is so that responses from the host are routed to the correct process.

1)	It looks like three connections: there are a set of [SYN][SYN. ACK][ACK] packets at the beginning of the log for each connection.
2)	Yes. Wireshark shows a HTTP packet sent from the client to the host with the GET command:
