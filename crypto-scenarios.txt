1.	First, Alice and Bob use Diffie-Hellman to exhcange a shared secret, to derive AES key K. From there, Alice can send her message M to Bob by C = AES(K, M) and he can decrypt it with AES_D(K, C).
Using symmetric encryption is better suited for Alice's long message. Eve cannot obtain the shared secret easily from the Diffie-Hellman exchange, so she will not have the key K to decrypt the message.

2.	First, Alice computes a signature Sig = E(S_A, H(M)). Alice sends Bob M||Sig, who is definitely in on the plan and can now verify the message: E(P_A, Sig) should equal H(M).
By including the signature using Alice's secret key, Mal cannot modify the message without Bob's notice because the signature will no longer match when Bob verifies it. 

3.	Alice and Bob use Diffie-Hellman to exchange a shared secret, and derive AES key K. From there, Alice computes her message C = AES(K, M), and additionally computes a signature Sig = E(S_A, H(M)). Alice sends Bob C||Sig, who is definitely in on the plan and can now decrypt and verify the message: AES_D(K, C) to get M, then H(M). To verify, E(P_A, Sig) should equal H(M).
The signature can only be from Alice as it makes use of her Public/private key pair.

4.	

5.	Sig_CA = E(S_CA, H("bob.com"||P_B))

6.	Bob should compute his own signature Sig_B = E(S_B, H(Cert_B)) and send Cert_B||Sig_B.

7.	Mal could impersonate the certificate authority, and give themselves a certificate proving that they're "Bob".
Or, Mal could attempt to intercept Bob's certificate request and insert their own public key instead.
